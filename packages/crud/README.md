Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

```ts
import fs from "fs";

export default function loadFile() {
    return fs.readFileSync("hello.ts");
}
```

The background color should be `#ffffff` for light mode and `#0d1117` for dark mode.

Here is a simple footnote[^1]

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2]

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier this foot note al
